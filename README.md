## Development Approach
We will be using User-Centered Design and Agile Scrum methodologies in this project. We will plan our work for 2-week sprints, beginning on Wednesdays and ending on Tuesdays (can be revisited). 

The following are standing ceremonies for the project team:

### Backlog Refinement 
  - Duration & Frequency: 60 minutes, 1x per week
  - Participants: Product Manager, Product Owner, Tech Lead (as needed), Design Lead (as needed)
  - Goal: Keep the backlog updated and work towards defining tasks and user stories for the next 2 sprints
  - Outcome: Updated backlog and user stories

### Daily Stand-up
  - Duration: 15 minutes, every day
  - Participants: Product Manager, Product Owner, Technical Lead, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, Design Lead, UX Researcher, Content Strategist
  - Goal: share accomplishments and obstacles/challenges* (not your typical status updates or a solutioning conversation)
  - Outcome: obstacles should be noted and resolved as soon as possible
    * Note: impediments should be raised immediately as they arise, outside of daily standups

### Sprint Planning
  - Duration & Frequency: 90 minutes (varies) - could be multiple sessions within one day, at the start of every sprint
  - Participants: Product Manager, Product Owner, Technical Lead, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, Design Lead, UX Researcher, Content Strategist
  - Goal: plan the sprint backlog for the next 2 weeks based on available capacity, refine and estimate user stories
  - Outcome: prioritized sprint backlog, capacity plan, refined and pointed user stories (estimated with points), team agreement on sprint commitments
  
### Sprint Retrospective
  - Duration & Frequency: 60 minutes, towards the end of the sprint
  - Participants: Product Manager, Product Owner, Technical Lead, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, Design Lead, UX Researcher, Content Strategist
  - Goal: plan the sprint backlog for the next 2 weeks based on available capacity, refine and estimate user stories
  - Outcome: prioritized sprint backlog, capacity plan, refined and pointed user stories (estimated with points), team agreement on sprint objectives and commitments
  
### Sprint Demo
  - Duration & Frequency: 60 minutes (varies), at the end of the sprint
  - Participants: whole team + relevant stakeholders
  - Goal: show completed work and get early feedback from stakeholders (incomplete work should not be shown)
  - Outcome: feedback, high-level acceptance of user stories**
  * Note: user stories still needs to meet definition of done to be considered "Done"
 
### Additional Team Meetings
 - Adhoc working sessions
 - User research and validation findings read-out (everyone is encouraged to attend) 

## Team Agreements
*To be added when team agreements are defined.*
 - Consider dedicated heads-down time
 
 ## Defition of Done
 *To be added when team agreements are defined.*
